# 3D-Obstacle-Detection-from-Point-Clouds
In this project, you will process a series of different 3D point clouds that are acquired by a laser scanner to perform obstacle detection for an autonomous vehicle. This project will be using point cloud data from the KITTI autonomous driving dataset http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/. It is processed to detect obstacles on the road such as cars, pedestrians, and cyclists. This will run using the ROS software as well as in a Linux environment such as Ubuntu. This project was ran in ROS Noetic.
